# flow_sensor_test
flow sensors are mainly used to help us have a touch on flow rates of certain fluids. in our project we need to determine the flow rate of our cryogenic liquid LOX  and Methane gas as fuel in order to control the mixung ratios for perfect atomization to optmize the thrust force to lift up the rocket (we are doing a rocket engine)  
This code measures the flow rate of a liquid using a flow sensor and displays the results on an LCD and serial monitor.
