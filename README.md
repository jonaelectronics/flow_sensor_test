# flow_sensor_test
flow sensors are mainly used to help use have a touch on flow rates of certain fluids. in our project we need to determine the flow rate of our cryogenic liquid LOX  and Methane gas as fuel 
Breakdown and Explanation of the   Code:
This code measures the flow rate of a liquid using a flow sensor and displays the results on an LCD and serial monitor.


#CONNECTIONS:
